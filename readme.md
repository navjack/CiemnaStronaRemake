# Ciemna Strona Remake

Data folder contains asset creation stuff, and the game folder contains the Adventure Game Studio project files.

# What?

Ciemna Strona is a Polish developed point and click adventure game for the Amiga computer system in 1997 by:

* Coder: Michał Speier (Michal Speier)
* Graphical Artist: Jarosław Figielski (Jaroslaw Figielski)
* Musician: Marcin Jaranowski
* Publisher: Diogenes

In its current state on the Amiga, it is unable to be completed. You must resort to modifications of the game to do so. But recently a group of people online were able to complete it and they have documented the ending and the steps required to get there. This will hopefully be the modernization effort that will be able to bring this game to a wider audience with a fully working version of the game.

More details and license information will be coming soon. (but in the meantime... consider everything here like public, like, i LITERALLY dont give a fuck what you do with anything here and i will gladly accept any requests that are forward progress)
