# Ciemna Strona Remake

## Developer stuff

Data folder contains asset creation stuff, and the game folder contains the Adventure Game Studio project files.

Everything should be happy if you put it in "C:\ciemna strona"

just clone this repo there or download the zip of it and put it there so you end up with

`C:\ciemna strona\data\*.*`

`C:\ciemna strona\game\*.*`

`C:\ciemna strona\readme.md`

### Ideas & Goals

* Recreate the game's main path from start to finish with no side areas or items or "quests"
* The game should be beatable following the SANCTIFIED walkthrough
* After that we fill out all the extra items and rooms
* Dynamic music system using the multitrack files of the original music to create tension or have a “hot / cold” hint system
* Censor scenes for stream safe setting

# What?

Ciemna Strona is a Polish developed point and click adventure game for the Amiga computer system in 1997 by:

* Coder: Michał Speier (Michal Speier)
* Graphical Artist: Jarosław Figielski (Jaroslaw Figielski)
* Musician: Marcin Jaranowski
* Publisher: Diogenes

In its current state on the Amiga, it is unable to be completed. You must resort to modifications of the game to do so. But recently a group of people online were able to complete it and they have documented the ending and the steps required to get there. This will hopefully be the modernization effort that will be able to bring this game to a wider audience with a fully working version of the game.

More details and license information will be coming soon. (but in the meantime... consider everything here like public, like, i LITERALLY dont give a fuck what you do with anything here and i will gladly accept any requests that are forward progress)
